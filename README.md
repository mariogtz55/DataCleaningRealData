# Road Segmentation with U-Net in PyTorch

This project focuses on segmenting roads from aerial images using a deep learning approach. 
It leverages the U-Net architecture implemented in PyTorch, trained on a subset of the 
Massachusetts Roads Dataset.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately identify and 
delineate road networks in aerial imagery. This has practical applications in various 
domains, including urban planning, map creation, and autonomous navigation.
